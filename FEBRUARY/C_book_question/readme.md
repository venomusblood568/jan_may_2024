Let's check each of the provided constants:

1\. -4689: This is a valid integer constant representing the negative number 4689.

2\. +-785: This is not a valid constant. In most programming languages, you cannot have both a positive and negative sign before a number.

3\. 4.25,325: This is not a valid constant. The comma is typically not allowed in decimal numbers; it's usually used as a separator.

4\. 1/4: This is not a valid constant. It represents a fraction, which is not typically supported as a constant in programming languages.

5\. 62-34-86: This is not a valid constant. It seems to represent a subtraction operation rather than a constant.

6\. 0234: This is a valid integer constant in some programming languages, specifically those that support octal notation. It represents the decimal number 156 (since 234 in octal is equivalent to 156 in decimal).

7\. 2A45: This is not a valid constant. It includes the letter 'A', which is not typically allowed in integer or decimal constants.

8\. Ox234: This is not a valid constant. 'Ox' is not a valid prefix for hexadecimal notation; it should be '0x' (zero followed by 'x'). Additionally, '234' is a valid hexadecimal number, representing the decimal number 564. So, the correct representation would be '0x234'.

In summary:

- Valid: -4689, 0234

- Invalid: +-785, 4.25,325, 1/4, 62-34-86, 2A45, Ox234

Pick the incorrect type declarations from the following list. Explain why they are incorrect.
(i) float, servo, mass, iota; (ii) int servo, digit, count; (iii) int rs.ps, unsigned; (iv) float real, root, big;

Let's analyze each type declaration list:

(i) float, servo, mass, iota;
All the type declarations in this list seem valid. They declare variables of type float, which is for floating-point numbers, and potentially other types like servo, mass, and iota. Without context, it's not possible to determine if these types are predefined or custom-defined, but syntactically, this list is correct.

(ii) int servo, digit, count;
This list also seems correct. It declares variables of type int (integer) named servo, digit, and count.

(iii) int rs.ps, unsigned;
This declaration list is incorrect. The variable names cannot contain a dot '.' in most programming languages. The dot '.' is typically used as a member access operator. So, int rs.ps is not a valid variable declaration. Also, 'unsigned' seems like a keyword specifying a type, but it's not followed by a variable name. It should be followed by a variable name to form a valid declaration.

(iv) float real, root, big;
This declaration list is correct. It declares variables of type float named real, root, and big.

In summary, the incorrect type declaration list is (iii) int rs.ps, unsigned; because of the invalid variable name with a dot '.' and the incomplete declaration with 'unsigned'.

Pick the incorrect floating point constants from the following list. Explain why they are incorrect.
(i) 40,943.65
(ii) 428.58
(iii) 46 + E2
(iv) 46E2
(v) 485. + 6
(vi) 462XE - 2
(vii) 425E2.5
(viti) 0045E + 6
(ix) 1/2.2 (x) 465.
(xi) 43

Let's analyze each floating-point constant:

(i) 40,943.65: This is incorrect because it contains a comma ',' as a digit separator, which is not allowed in floating-point constants in most programming languages.

(ii) 428.58: This is correct. It represents the floating-point number 428.58.

(iii) 46 + E2: This is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to represent a floating-point number using exponential notation, but the '+' sign is not correctly used. Exponential notation typically uses 'E' or 'e' to indicate the exponent.

(iv) 46E2: This is correct. It represents the number 4600 in exponential notation (46 * 10^2).

(v) 485. + 6: This is incorrect. The '+' operator is not valid in a floating-point constant, and the number after the '+' is not correctly represented.

(vi) 462XE - 2: This is incorrect. It seems to be an attempt at exponential notation, but 'XE' is not a valid format. It should use 'E' or 'e'.

(vii) 425E2.5: This is incorrect. Exponential notation should only have an integer exponent. The decimal point in the exponent is not valid.

(viti) 0045E + 6: This is incorrect. The number seems to be in exponential notation, but the leading zeros before '0045' are unnecessary.

(ix) 1/2.2: This is incorrect. It's not a valid floating-point constant. It represents a fraction, not a single floating-point value.

(x) 465.: This is correct. It represents the floating-point number 465.

(xi) 43: This is correct. Although it doesn't have a decimal point, it can be interpreted as a floating-point constant with a zero fractional part.

In summary, the incorrect floating-point constants are:
(i) 40,943.65
(iii) 46 + E2
(v) 485. + 6
(vi) 462XE - 2
(vii) 425E2.5
(viti) 0045E + 6
(ix) 1/2.2
