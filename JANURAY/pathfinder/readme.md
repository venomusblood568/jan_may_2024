# Pygame Pathfinding Visualizer

This Python application uses Pygame to visualize pathfinding on a grid, incorporating the `pathfinding` module for efficient pathfinding algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Dependencies

Install Pygame and the pathfinding module using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash

pip install pygame

pip install pathfinding

```

## Running the Application

Run the `main.py` file to start the Pygame visualizer:

```bash

python main.py

```

## Customizing the Grid

Customize the grid by modifying the `matrix` variable in the `main.py` file. The `1` values represent obstacles, and `0` represents open paths:

```python

matrix = [

    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],

    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

]

```

Adjust the `start` and `end` variables to set the starting and ending points on the grid:

```python

start = grid.node(0, 0)

end = grid.node(5, 2)

```

## Pathfinding Algorithm

The application uses the A* algorithm with diagonal movement enabled. Customize the algorithm by changing the `finder` variable in the `main.py` file:

```python

finder = AStarFinder(diagonal_movement=DiagonalMovement.always)

```

## Enjoy Exploring Paths!

Experiment with different grid configurations and observe how the A* algorithm finds the shortest path.
